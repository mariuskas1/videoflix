            <h3>Processing Activities</h3>
            <h3>Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website</h3>
            Type and Purpose of Processing
            When you access our website, i.e., if you do not register or otherwise submit information, general information is automatically collected. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your internet service provider, your IP address, and similar.

            They are processed specifically to ensure the website is displayed correctly and optimized.

            We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. However, we reserve the right to retrospectively check the server log files if there are concrete indications of unlawful use.

            
            <h3>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest</h3>
            Processing is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website, as well as ensuring system security and detecting misuse (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

            <h3>Recipients</h3>
            The recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.

            <h3>Retention Period</h3>
            Data will be deleted no later than six months after the contact request is processed.

            If a contractual relationship is established, we are subject to the legal retention periods, which are generally six or ten years due to requirements of proper bookkeeping and tax regulations.

            <h3>Provision Required or Necessary</h3>
            Providing your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only process your inquiry if you provide us with the necessary data and the reason for the inquiry.

            <h3>Objection</h3>
            Please refer to the information about your right to object under Art. 21 GDPR below.

            <h3>Information on Your Right to Object Under Art. 21 GDPR</h3>
            <h3>Right to Object on a Case-by-Case Basis</h3>
            You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you, which is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (data processing based on a balance of interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 4 GDPR.

            If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims.
